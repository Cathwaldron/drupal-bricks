<p>Modern websites require the brand new understanding of what content is and how it is structured. Well-organized content architecture makes the website semantically transparent and the content management process simple and clear. Today by term “content” we don’t mean narrative content. <em>Not anymore. </em>That’s why things like Markdown or WYSIWYG are just not enough.</p>

<p>“We’re not designing pages, we’re designing systems of components.” — <em>Stephen Hay</em></p>

<p>There are a plenty of proven concepts and modules which aimed to help us here: Display Suite, Panels, Panelizer and of course Paragraphs. But with Drupal 8 release we have a lot of opportunities right in core and our mission is to utilize them as much as possible to get the same functionality (or even more!).</p>

<p>In this session we will try to define a set of common problems when building rich websites with dynamic layouts and to design a solution for creating content for such websites. We will try to use Drupal 8 core modules widely, and especially Entity Reference because of its flexibility and wide support in contrib modules. Finally we will go through a live demo of a complete sandbox website.</p>

<p>The following topics will be highlighted:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How to structure a page? In which independent components to split and how granularly?</li>
	<li>How to re-use content throughout website? How to render the same content differently depending on context? How to just re-style without rendering differently?</li>
	<li>How to nest components? How to aim flat nesting to get maximum performance?</li>
	<li>How to organize templates?</li>
	<li>How to refer to a specific revision of an entity?</li>
	<li>How to translate a content with layout? How to translate a content partially?</li>
	<li>How to build custom layouts right in admin UI? How to share layouts between components?</li>
	<li>How to implement components with dynamic content? Like Views?</li>
	<li>How to get a maximum benefit from a semantically structured content? How to get responsive design done automatically?</li>
</ul>

<p>The following modules will be covered:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Entity Reference</li>
	<li>Quick Edit</li>
	<li>Contextual Links</li>
	<li>Entity Construction Kit</li>
	<li>Entity Translation</li>
	<li>Entity Reference Revisions</li>
	<li>Dynamic Entity Reference</li>
	<li>References dialog</li>
	<li>Inline Entity Form</li>
	<li>Entity Reference Live Preview</li>
	<li>Entity reference viewmode selector</li>
	<li>Entity view modes</li>
	<li>Viewfield</li>
</ul>

<p>In this session I want to share a real experience when designing a content architecture for large multi-lingual and multi-layout websites for <a href="http://www.acronis.com/" target="_blank">enterprise</a> and <a href="http://en.cs.msu.ru/" target="_blank">academics</a>.</p>

<p>These very simple but extremely flexible techniques can be used for <em>any</em> entity type (not just Paragraphs!) and in almost <em>any</em> project. Re-understand your content today and create your own site buidling experience on top of Entity Reference from Drupal 8 core and its wide contrib ecosystem!</p>
