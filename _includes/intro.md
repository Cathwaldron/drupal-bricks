**Bricks** â€” is a new way of building pages on top of Entity Reference, Display Modes, Layout API, tabledrag.js and [Flat Tables](http://evolt.org/node/4047#table). Everything is in Drupal core that makes Bricks ultra-lightweight and developer-friendly.

In terms of concept Bricks is a new generation of Paragraphs, an alternative to Panelizer and a good friend to ECK, Inline Entity Form and your favorite WYSIWYG. Shortly, it allows you to nest Entity Reference field items using Drupal drag & drop UI (exactly like for menu or taxonomy items).
