**Bricks** â€” is a revolutionary new way of creating rich content in Drupal. Thanks to the powerful contributions like ECK and Entity Reference, Bricks itself is just ~13 KB of code (gzipped).

In terms of concept Bricks is a new generation of [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs), drop-in replacement for [Panelizer](https://www.drupal.org/project/panelizer) and a good friend to [Display Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/ds) and [CKEditor](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor) or any other [WYSIWYG](https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg).

Bricks allows you to nest field items using Drupal drag & drop UI (exactly like for menu or taxonomy items).
