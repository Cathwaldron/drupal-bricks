**Bricks** â€” is a revolutionary new way of creating rich content in Drupal. Thanks to the powerful contributions like ECK and Entity Reference, Bricks itself is just ~9 KB of code.

In terms of concept Bricks is a new generation of [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs), drop-in replacement for [Panelizer](https://www.drupal.org/project/panelizer) and a good friend to [Display Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/ds) and [CKEditor](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor) or any other [WYSIWYG](https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg).

## Live demo

1. Open [pre-configured sandbox](https://simplytest.me/project/bricks/8.x-1.x) on simplytest.me.
2. Click **Launch sandbox** and wait.
3. Follow the installation (all settings should be pre-filled, don't change them).
4. Go to **Extend** and install **Bricks Bootstrap**.
5. Go to **Appearance**, install **Tweme** and set as default theme.
6. Finally go to **Content** and create your first **Bricky** page!

Proposed page layout:

You can nest items using Drupal drag & drop UI (like for menu or taxonomy items).
