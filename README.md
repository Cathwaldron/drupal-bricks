**Bricks** â€” is a revolutionary new way of creating rich content in Drupal. Thanks to the powerful contributions like ECK and Entity Reference, Bricks itself is just ~13 KB of code (gzipped).

In terms of concept Bricks is a new generation of [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs), drop-in replacement for [Panelizer](https://www.drupal.org/project/panelizer) and a good friend to [Display Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/ds) and [CKEditor](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor) or any other [WYSIWYG](https://www.drupal.org/project/wysiwyg).

![Bricks UI](https://www.drupal.org/files/bricks-ui-8.x.png)

Bricks allows you to nest field items using Drupal drag & drop UI (exactly like for menu or taxonomy items).


## Live demo

1. Open [pre-configured sandbox](https://simplytest.me/project/bricks/8.x-1.2).
2. Click **Launch sandbox** and wait.
3. Follow the installation (all settings should be pre-filled, don't change them).
4. Go to **Extend** and install **Bricks Bootstrap**.
5. Go to **Appearance**, install **Tweme** and set as default theme.
6. Find a sample 3-columns node and go to **Edit** mode to check magic out!
7. Finally go to **Content** and create your own first **Bricky** page!


## Requirements

All new Bricks for D8 has no requirements and works with ANY entity types!

*Just make sure nested entities have a proper templates, like `templates/brick--columns.html.twig`.*
